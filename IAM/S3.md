IAM policy to block all access to S3 unless it originates from the VPC/VPCe in the listed accounts:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "Policy1415115909152",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Block all access except for account VPCs",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "s3:AWSAccountID": [
            "012345678912",
            "112345678912",
            "212345678912",
            "312345678912",
            "412345678912"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

IAM policy that allows the recipient access to a specific bucket. Works for Cloudberry Explorer and may be useful for other similar tools and backup software. Replace ${bucket-name} with the actual name of the bucket.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::${bucket-name}",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::${bucket-name}\/*",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
```
