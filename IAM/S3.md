S3 Bucket Policy to only allow access from VPC endpoint and external IP of your office/datacenter firewall - blocks public Internet access completely (unless your source IP matches):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "Policy1415115909152",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Access-to-specific-VPCE-and-IP",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "NotIpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": [
            "142.53.7.219\/32"
          ]
        },
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "aws:sourceVpce": "vpce-0c3ddb65"
        }
      },
      "Principal": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

IAM policy that allows the recipient access to a specific bucket. Works for Cloudberry Explorer and may be useful for other similar tools and backup software. Replace ${bucket-name} with the actual name of the bucket.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::${bucket-name}",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::${bucket-name}\/*",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
```
