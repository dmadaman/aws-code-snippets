```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::${bucket-name}",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::${bucket-name}\/*",
